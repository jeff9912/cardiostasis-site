                    <p>(unreleased) Cardiostasis puts a new twist on the classic metal track "Creeping Death" by Metallica. The reason we chose and love this song, is for its insane power. The intro part already blasts in your face and it only builds up from there, the songs main riff is insanely powerful, its solo is crazy melodic, and the song nicely build off with a nice harmony section. This cover is set to release on Cardiostasis's second album, which will be a cover album. </p>

            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>Cardiostasis is the new and upcoming Alternative rock/metal band! tons of influences from Various bands such as: Deftones, Bring Me The Horizon, Trivium, Parkway Drive, Megadeth, Metallica, My Bloody Valentine, Avenged Sevenfold, Superheaven, Gojira, Five Finger Death Punch, Bullet for my valentine, Slowdive, Architects, Motionless In White, Papa Roach, Foo Fighters, Van Halen, Killswitch Engage, Black Sabbath, Lamb Of God, Rage against the machine, Korn And many more. These band have been a great contributor to our sound, and makes us the sound we have today</p>
            <p>Cardiostasis has always been a team effort, we feel like teamwork is the essence of playing in a (good) band. Communication is key, especially when playing for an audience. Playing a song live Lights up your body, your soul, your mind in ways that you could never imagine. Now playing your own song doubles that feel. To play your own song for an audience is just an outer world experience, to have created a track and playing this for people who actually love it just brings us a different kind of happiness</p>
            <p id="make_this_italic">"Cardiostasis is more than just a band, Its a brotherhood, if one of us wouldnt be here, none of us would be here."</p>
